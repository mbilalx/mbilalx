# 👋 Hi, I'm Muhammad Bilal

I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer with over five years of experience building scalable web platforms, clean backend services, and rich front-end interfaces. My core strengths lie in Python, PHP, Laravel, and Vue.js — and I'm passionate about creating solutions that drive real-world impact.

## 🚧 Why My GitHub Activity Might Appear Limited
Most of my contributions come from **client and company projects hosted on private GitHub repositories** that are not under my personal account. These include:

- Developing real-time IoT data processing pipelines
- Architecting scalable APIs and background job systems
- Managing full-stack feature delivery across agile sprints
- Rebuilding legacy systems with modern tools

Due to confidentiality and ownership policies, this work is not publicly visible on my GitHub contribution graph.

## 🧠 Public Projects (Coming Soon)
To demonstrate my capabilities in a more transparent way, I’m actively working on:

- 🔧 A minimalist microservice project using **FastAPI**, **Docker**, and **GitHub Actions**
- 📈 A portfolio of small, production-grade components reflecting real-world engineering practices

These projects will include:
- Clean codebase & documentation
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Modular architecture
- Docker-based deployment
